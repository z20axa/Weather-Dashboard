# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard app that runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

The app uses the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) from the Open Weather Map server side to retrieve weather data for cities.

It also uses 'localStorage' to store any persistent data. 

<!-- 
The base URL should look like the following: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

**Hint**: Using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API, you'll notice that you will need to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name. Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs, how could we retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name?

For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys). -->
